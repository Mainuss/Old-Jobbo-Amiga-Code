# Old-Jobbo-Amiga-Code

This is a collection of Amiga demo routines lifted from my old A1200.

Most are from around 1994-97, there are two intros in here along with lots of unfinished effects.

These were originally assembled using Devpac3, that still works for me in the emulator. They should all run on a stock A1200. Some were intended for A500 but might not work without some code adjustments.

Some of the effects:
